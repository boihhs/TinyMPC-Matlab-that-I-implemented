I realized that I didn't code it exactlly as it actually is supposed to. However, my way might be more memory efficent but doens't follow constriants as well as all the constraints are put into one slack varible instead of a slack varible per constraint
Also the angle doesn't work that well, but setting cos(theta) = 1 worked the best for me for limiting the angle of gimble while still working (To this day this confusies me, but what else can I do). Also changing the order that the constraints are projected onto the slack varible can change how well certian constraints work. Lastly another improvement can be dynamically changing the penality function.
